Python3 Control of Arduino Data Logger


Some updates on the python3 gui controlling an arduino nano script for a stepper motor/load cell... 
merged latest revision of the main arduino code as well as the python gui to control it.. 

Still does not work as I hoped.. stepper is being delayed when writing to the serial monitor.. baud rate issues? 
HELP!!
